# Echo-1
This is a project to build a large RC airplane with the capacity to carry things beneath (and possibly above it). The intent is to use a combination of 3d printing, wood, and some composite materials.

Description of workflow:
1. We will use github for maintaining an up-to-date set of CAD models.
2. We will use the google drive folder for keeping up Google sheets with information about the aircraft (including dimensions, performance, etc).
3. Weight and balance of the aircraft is critical. This should be maintained on a part-by-part basis in the Autodesk inventor files. That way we can have an up-to-date understanding of the aircraft's weight and balance.
4. Steps for moving forward with the project are stored in the following Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ryN1HHEpoUiay4ZsaMLdJubncn9c42_Q56tH5SfQFSc/edit
Yes, this is in the drive folder too.
